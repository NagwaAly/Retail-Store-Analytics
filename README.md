# Retail-Store-Analytics
This repository contains a complete Retail Store Analytics Project, built from scratch to demonstrate the full journey of transforming raw data into actionable business insights.

🔹 Project Overview
The project covers the entire data pipeline:

Data Modeling: Designed an ERD and transformed it into a Star Schema with a central FactSales table and multiple dimension tables (Products, Customers, Orders, Payments, Returns, Discounts, Date).

Data Generation: Used Faker function to create realistic synthetic data for testing.

SQL Analysis: Built queries to extract insights such as sales per category, yearly sales, and sales per channel.

Python Analysis: Conducted statistical analysis and visualizations to uncover customer behavior and sales trends.

Excel Analysis & Dashboard: Created pivot tables, summary reports, and an Excel Dashboard to validate and visualize KPIs quickly.

Power BI Dashboards: Designed interactive dashboards to visualize KPIs, customer metrics, discounts & returns, and sales channels.
